Caesar Cipher – Python Implementation

A simple and effective Python program that demonstrates the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique — one of the oldest and most widely known methods in cryptography.

 Description

This project allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a shift-based substitution algorithm.
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Example:
With a shift of 1 →
A → B, B → C, C → D, and so on.

This cipher was famously used by Julius Caesar to send encoded messages to his generals.

✨ Features

🔐 Encrypt any text message using a shift value (1–25)

🔓 Decrypt encrypted messages with the same shift

 Preserves uppercase/lowercase letters

 Keeps spaces, numbers, and punctuation unchanged

 Simple and interactive command-line interface

📌 Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed  everything is implemented using built-in Python functions.
